# Contributing to Cardano World

Issues and Pull Requests welcome! Basic issues (like typo changes for example) should be
done via a PR fixing it rather than opening an issue asking someone to fix it.

## Pull Request Process

1. Run `direnv reload` before committing anything to ensure the devshell functions.
2. Ensure documentation is up-to-date for the changes made.
3. PR can be auto-merged with `bors` or merged by a maintainer manually after review.
