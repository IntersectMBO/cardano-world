    -- request g_out seconds before the remote end becomes idle.

    -- Now it turns out to be more convenient to measure this not in time, but
    -- based on the number of bytes of requests that are in-flight. This of
    -- course directly corresponds to time, via S_in.

    -- of bytes that can be in flight during a time interval t. So we need

    -- scheduling and cannot initiate the request at exactly the right time, so
