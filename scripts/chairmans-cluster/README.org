* What

This is scaffolding around the CI cluster test, which:

- runs 7 block forging nodes
- organised in two fully-connected segments connected by a single proxy
- runs the Chairman application to test consensus:
  1. no forks longer than 'k' slots,
  2. sufficient blocks were made during the cluster run

Two scripts are provided:

 - =cluster-test.sh= will:
   - run the test, exactly the way it's run in CI
   - collect the log output into an appropriately named logfile
   - run the log splitter (see description of the next script)

 - =cluster-log-split.sh= will:
   - take a logfile from the previous step and:
   - perform various analyses on that logfile,
   - culminating in producing a block chart as seen by each node

* Prerequisites

Prerequisites include having the Nix package manager installed and suitably
configured.

Configuration consists of ensuring `/etc/nix/nix.conf` have:

1. The IOHK Hydra binary cache enabled:

   - https://hydra.iohk.io must be in either of the `substituters` or the
     `binary-caches` space-separated list options
   - <b><span>hydra.iohk.io</span>:f/Ea+s+dFdN+3Y/G+FDgSq+a5NEWhJGzdjvKNGv0/EQ</b> must be
     present in the `public-keys` space-separated list option

2. Configuration allowing KVM to be used by Nix:

   `kvm` and `nixos-test` must be in the `system-features` space-separated list option

   The effective configuration can be observed as follows:

    `$ nix show-config | grep system-features`<br/>
    `system-features = benchmark big-parallel kvm nixos-test`

* Running the test

Simply execute =scripts/chairmans-cluster/cluster-test.sh=.

A log file for the entire cluster's output will appear in a file named
=cluster.EPOCHTIME.COMMIT-ID.STATUS.MNEMONIC.log=.

* Logs analysis output

The log analyser will produce a directory named after the logfile.
The results of that analysis is grouped into a set of subdirectories, one per node

In the generated =.png= charts:

  - blue-colored blocks are made by Byron Rewrite nodes,
  - green-colored blocks are made by Byron Legacy nodes,
  - arrow labels have the public key of the block signer & its BFT id.
