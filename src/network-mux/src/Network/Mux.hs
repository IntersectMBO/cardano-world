-- | muxStart starts a mux bearer for the specified protocols corresponding to
-- one of the provided Versions.
--
-- __Isometric flow control: analysis of head-of-line blocking of the ingress side of the multiplexer__
--
-- For each mini-protocol (enumeratated by @ptcl@), mux will create two
-- channels. One for initiator and one for the responder.  Each channel will use
-- a single 'Wanton'.  When it is filled, it is put in a common queue
-- 'tsrQueue'.  This means that the queue is bound by @2 * |ptcl|@.  Every side
-- of a mini-protocol is served by a single 'Wanton': when an applicaiton sends
-- data, the channel will try to put it into the 'Wanton' (which might block).
-- 'Wanton's are taken from the 'tsrQueue' queue by one of mux threads.  This
-- elimnates head of line blocking: each mini-protocol thread can block on
-- puting more bytes into its 'Wanton', but it cannot block the other
-- mini-protocols or the thread that is reading the 'tsrQueue' queue.  This is
-- ensured since the 'muxChannel' will put only a non-empty 'Wanton' to the
-- 'tsrQueue' queue, and on such wantons the queue is never blocked.  This means
-- that  the only way the queue can block is when its empty, which means that
-- none of the mini-protocols wanted to send.  The egress part will read
-- a 'Wanton', take a fixed amount of bytes encode them in as an 'MuxSDU'; if
-- there are leftovers it will put them back in the 'Wanton' and place it at the
-- end of the queue (reading and writting to it will happen in a single STM
-- transaction which assures that the order of requests from a mini-protocol is
-- preserved.
--
-- Properties:
--
-- * at any given time the 'tsrQueue' contains at most one
--   'TranslocationServiceRequest' from a given mini-protocol of the given
--   'MiniProtocolDir', thus the queue contains at most @2 * |ptcl|@
--   translocation requests.
-- * at any given time each @TranslocationServiceRequest@ contains a non-empty
-- 'Wanton'
