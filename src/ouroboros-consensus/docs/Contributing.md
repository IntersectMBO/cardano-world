# How to contribute to the Consensus Layer

If you're not working for IOHK, please fork the repository on GitHub and open
PRs that way. We're excited about your involvement; thank you! If you've
recently joined IOHK, see [IOHK.md][iohk-onboarding] for additional setup.

Please read the following documents when beginning to contribute to the
Consensus Layer in this repository. A note about expectations: the rules about
style and process document our ideal scenario, but we don't expect repository
newcomers to get them right immediately; we'll guide you through them when
reviewing your PRs. We appreciate however much effort you can afford at the
start.
