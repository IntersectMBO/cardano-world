  -- | Get a (historical) forecast at the given slot
  --
  -- Returns 'Nothing' if the given slot is too far in the past.
  -- It is an 'error' to call this with a slot in the future.
  --
  -- This forecast can be used to validate headers of blocks within the range
  -- of the forecast. These blocks do not necessarily need to live on the same
  -- branch as the current ledger, but the slot at which the forecast is
  -- obtained must be within @k@ blocks from the tip.
  --
  -- The range of the forecast should allow to validate a sufficient number of
  -- headers to validate an alternative chain longer than ours, so that chain
  -- selection can decide whether or not we prefer the alternative chain to our
  -- current chain. In addition, it would be helpful, though not essential, if
  -- we can look further ahead than that, as this would improve sync
  -- performance.
  --
  -- NOTE (difference between 'ledgerViewForecastAt' and 'applyChainTick'):
  -- Both 'ledgerViewForecastAt' and 'applyChainTick' can be used to obtain
  -- a protocol ledger view for a future slot. The difference between the two
  -- is that 'applyChainTick' assumes no blocks are present between the current
  -- ledger tip and the specified 'SlotNo', whereas 'ledgerViewForecastAt'
  -- cannot make such an assumption. Thus, 'applyChainTick' cannot fail, whereas
  -- the forecast returned by 'ledgerViewForecastAt' might report an
  -- 'OutsideForecastRange' for the same 'SlotNo'. We expect the two functions
  -- to produce the same view whenever the 'SlotNo' /is/ in range, however;
  -- see 'lemma_ledgerViewForecastAt_applyChainTick'.

-- | Get a 'Forecast' from the tip of the ledger
