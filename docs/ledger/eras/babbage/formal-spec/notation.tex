\section{Notation}

This specification features some changes to the notation used in previous specifications.

\begin{description}
\item[Maps and partial functions] We use the notation $f : A \pto B$
  to denote a finitely supported partial function. If $B$ is a monoid,
  $f$ is a function such that $f a = 0$ for all but finitely many
  $a$. Otherwise it is a function $f : A \to B^?$ such that
  $f a = \Nothing$ for all but finitely many $a$.
\item[Map operations] We use standard notation for restriction and
  corestriction of functions to operate on partial functions as well.
\end{description}
