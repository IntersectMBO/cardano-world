\section{Introduction}

The focus of this document is to give a description of the changes
required to support multi-assets on the Shelley ledger as described in
\cite{utxo_ma}. These multi-assets are implemented via token bundles,
given by a type called $\Value$, which replace the type $\Coin$ of the
Shelley ledger in many (but not all) cases.

All aspects of the ledger not given in this document are as specified
in the Shelley ledger design and implementation~\cite{shelley_spec},
but if they depend on something that is changed in this version of the
ledger they must use the definitions from this document.
