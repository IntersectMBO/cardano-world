\section{Notation}

In addition to the notation in the Shelley specification, we use the following notations:

\begin{description}
\item[Functions with finite support] For a monoid $M$, $A \to_0 M$
  are the functions $f : A \to M$ with finite support, i.e. such that
  there exist only finitely many $a \in A$ such that $f a \neq 0$. We
  denote the support of $f$ by $\supp f$, which is defined as
  $\supp f := \{ a \in A : f a \neq 0 \}$.
\end{description}
