\section{Implementation of \fun{txSize}}
\label{sec:txSize}

The minimum fee calculation in Figure~\ref{fig:defs:protocol-parameters-helpers}
depends on an abstract $\fun{txSize}$ function.
We have implemented $\fun{txSize}$ as the number of bytes in the CBOR serialization
of the transaction, as defined in Appendix~\ref{sec:cddl}.
