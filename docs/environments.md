# Environments

The official Cardano Environment configuration files:

## Throw-away Devnets

Usage: Hard fork testing, Testing new release functionality that needs public involvement

These can be spun up/torn down at any time by release manager for specific tests, such as hard forks.

These are shared with the community for early involvment before a release candidate is mature.

Recieves updates for official releases, release candidates and occasionally custom tags that aren't candidates for release

### Vasil-Dev

- [Node Config](environments/vasil-dev/config.json)
- [Node Topology](environments/vasil-dev/topology.json)
- [Db Sync Config](environments/vasil-dev/config.json)
- [Subit API Config](environments/vasil-dev/config.json)
- [Byron Genesis](environments/vasil-dev/byron-genesis.json)
- [Shelley Genesis](environments/vasil-dev/shelley-genesis.json)
- [Alonzo Genesis](environments/vasil-dev/alonzo-genesis.json)

## Shelley-QA (Internal Only)

Usage: Testing all new functionality. Ideally automatically deployed off of master on every commit

Ideally, stays long running to build up history, although the nature of early testing can potentially
break it. In the past we have disaster recoveried it since we control all the keys.

## Preview Testnet

_Not deployed yet_

Usage: Testing release candidates and mainnet releases. Leads mainnet hard forks by at least 4 weeks.

Ideally stays long running. Only if an issue is found after it forks that's breaking should it be respun.

Epoch length of 1 day. Development flags allowed in configuration files.

Upgrade Stragegy:

- Release Candidates - 1/3 of nodes
- Official Releases - 2/3 of nodes
- Hard forks - all nodes
- Community requested to only deploy release candidates and official releases

## Pre-Production Testnet

Usage: Testing release candidates and mainnet releases. Forks at approximately same time as mainnet (within an epoch of each other).

Long running. Since this parallels mainnet, if a bug occurs here, it needs fixed properly and can not be respun.

Upgrade Stragegy:

- Release Candidates - 1/3 of nodes
- Official Releases - 2/3 of nodes
- Hard forks - all nodes
- Community requested to only deploy release candidates and official releases

## Production (Mainnet)

Usage: Live Production. Only gets official mainnet releases.

Upgrade Stragegy:

- Official Releases - Deploy 1 pool and it's relays every 24 hours
- Community requested to only deploy official releases
