module Network.Mux.DeltaQTraceStatsSupport
where

-- This module is making use of hackage statisitical libraries. They
-- are not the most efficicient approches for this particlular use
-- case, and they may increase the package dependencies for the final
-- binaries (they have a lot of dependencies).
--
-- It may well be worthwhile constructing specialsed version for the
-- specific use case, but building those and creating the associated
-- test suite was not deemed a good use of time (at the time of
-- creation).
--
-- Definite space/time optimisation task here.
