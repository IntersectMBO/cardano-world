# IOHK-level access to the Consensus Layer

Work with your IOHK manager and IOHK DevOps to acquire permissions to push
branches to and open PRs in this repository. If you're working as part of the
Consensus Team, also acquire permissions to Approve PRs (in particular, our
`bors` bot must accept your commands). You'll eventually also need to be in the
`CODEOWNERS` file.

The general IOHK onboarding should have discussed establishing hardware-based
Two Factor Authentication on your GitHub account; that's another prerequisite.

We're currently bridging the gap with both GitHub Issues and tickets in IOHK's
JIRA. For now, we are therefore also mentioning JIRA Issues such as `CAD-NNNN`
in issues' and PRs' titles and/or descriptions.
