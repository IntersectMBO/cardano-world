  -- | Apply "slot based" state transformations
  --
  -- When a block is applied to the ledger state, a number of things happen
  -- purely based on the slot number of that block. For example:
  --
  -- * In Byron, scheduled updates are applied, and the update system state is
  --   updated.
  -- * In Shelley, delegation state is updated (on epoch boundaries).
  --
  -- The consensus layer must be able to apply such a "chain tick" function,
  -- primarily when validating transactions in the mempool (which, conceptually,
  -- live in "some block in the future") or when extracting valid transactions
  -- from the mempool to insert into a new block to be produced.
  --
  -- This is not allowed to throw any errors. After all, if this could fail,
  -- it would mean a /previous/ block set up the ledger state in such a way
  -- that as soon as a certain slot was reached, /any/ block would be invalid.
  --
  -- PRECONDITION: The slot number must be strictly greater than the slot at
  -- the tip of the ledger (except for EBBs, obviously..).
  --
  -- NOTE: 'applyChainTick' should /not/ change the tip of the underlying ledger
  -- state, which should still refer to the most recent applied /block/. In
  -- other words, we should have
  --
  -- >    ledgerTipPoint (applyChainTick cfg slot st)
  -- > == ledgerTipPoint st
