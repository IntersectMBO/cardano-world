-- | Check database marker
--
-- The database folder will contain folders for the ImmutableDB (@immutable@),
-- the VolatileDB (@volatile@), and the LedgerDB (@ledger@). All three
-- subdatabases can delete files from these folders, e.g., outdated files or
-- files that are deemed invalid.
--
-- For example, when starting a node that will connect to a testnet with a
-- database folder containing mainnet blocks, these blocks will be deemed
-- invalid and will be deleted. This would throw away a perfectly good chain,
-- possibly consisting of gigabytes of data that will have to be synched
-- again.
--
-- To protect us from unwanted deletion of valid files, we first check whether
-- we have been given the path to the right database folder. We do this by
-- reading the 'ProtocolMagicId' of the net from a file stored in the root of
-- the database folder. This file's name is defined in 'dbMarkerFile'.
--
-- * If the 'ProtocolMagicId' from the file matches that of the net, we have
--   the right database folder.
-- * If not, we are opening the wrong database folder and abort by throwing a
--   'DbMarkerError'.
-- * If there is no such file and the folder is empty, we create it and store
--   the net's 'ProtocolMagicId' in it.
-- * If there is no such file, but the folder is not empty, we throw a
--   'DbMarkerError', because we have likely been given the wrong path,
--   maybe to a folder containing user or system files. This includes the case
--   that the 'dbMarkerFile' has been deleted.
-- * If there is such a 'dbMarkerFile', but it could not be read or its
--   contents could not be parsed, we also throw a 'DbMarkerError'.
--
-- Note that an 'FsError' can also be thrown.
